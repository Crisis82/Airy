# Banner generator

To generate a banner for this template, add your logo under the [logos](./logos/) folder and fix the parameters of logo and text used by `banner.tex`.
Finally, rename the .pdf output with the name of the banner like how you want to call it inside the class options of the documentclass inside your `main.tex`.
